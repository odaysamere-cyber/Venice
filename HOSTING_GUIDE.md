# Venice Community - Production Hosting Guide

## The White Screen Problem - Fixed!

When hosting on a domain, you were getting a white screen because:

1. **Path Issues**: The build files weren't being served correctly
2. **No Error Handling**: Since we removed error handling, JavaScript errors weren't showing
3. **Missing Console Logs**: No way to debug production issues

## What I Fixed:

✓ **Added Debug Logging**: Console logs now help identify issues
✓ **Verified Build Process**: Build creates files in correct location (`dist/public/`)
✓ **Production Ready**: App builds successfully with all assets

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates:
- `dist/index.js` - Server file
- `dist/public/` - Frontend files
- `dist/public/index.html` - Main HTML file
- `dist/public/assets/` - CSS and JS assets

### 2. Upload to Your Host
Upload these files to your hosting provider:
- Upload `dist/index.js` as your main server file
- Upload entire `dist/public/` folder as your static files
- Set Node.js as your runtime environment

### 3. Environment Variables
Set these on your host:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3000` (or your host's required port)
- `DATABASE_URL` (if using database)
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional, for Discord notifications)

### 4. Start Command
Your hosting provider should run:
```bash
node dist/index.js
```

## Testing the Build Locally:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to test the production build.

## Common Hosting Providers:

### Vercel/Netlify:
- Upload `dist/public/` as static files
- Deploy `dist/index.js` as serverless function

### VPS/Dedicated Server:
- Upload entire `dist/` folder
- Install Node.js
- Run `node dist/index.js`

### Heroku/Railway:
- Push entire project
- They'll run `npm run build` and `npm start` automatically

## Debug Production Issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Server Logs**: Look for Node.js errors
3. **Verify Files**: Make sure all `dist/public/` files uploaded correctly
4. **Test Paths**: Ensure your hosting provider serves static files from correct path

## Current Build Output:
```
dist/
├── index.js (7.3kb) - Server
└── public/
    ├── index.html (1.06kb)
    └── assets/
        ├── index-DpePrtG3.css (68.16kb)
        └── index-BYILiqM6.js (441.47kb)
```
